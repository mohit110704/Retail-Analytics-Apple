SQL queries and analysis for retail sales and warranty data

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced SQL queries using a large Apple retail sales dataset. The data includes products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims from Apple stores around the world.

The goal is to answer real business questions—from simple summaries to more complex analyses—such as sales trends, product performance, warranty patterns, and store comparisons.
